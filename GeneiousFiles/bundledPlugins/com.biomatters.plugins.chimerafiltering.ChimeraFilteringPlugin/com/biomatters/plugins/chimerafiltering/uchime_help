</pre><b>UCHIME 4.2 by Robert C. Edgar</b>

Some of the following options for UCHIME 4.2 may be different in USEARCH. If &quot;Use USEARCH instead&quot; is selected, refer to documentation for chimera filtering in the appropriate version of USEARCH. The relevant sections are &quot;Chimera filtering&quot; and &quot;All options&quot;.

Usage
-----

uchime --input query.fasta [--db db.fasta] [--uchimeout results.uchime]
    [--uchimealns results.alns]

Options
-------

--input filename
    Query sequences in FASTA format.
    If the --db option is not specificed, uchime uses de novo
    detection. In de novo mode, relative abundance must be given
    by a string /ab=xxx/ somewhere in the label, where xxx is a
    floating-point number, e.g. >F00QGH67HG/ab=1.2/.

--db filename
    Reference database in FASTA format.
    Optional, if not specified uchime uses de novo mode.

    ***WARNING*** The database is searched ONLY on the plus strand.
    You MUST include reverse-complemented sequences in the database
    if you want both strands to be searched.

--abskew x
    Minimum abundance skew. Default 1.9. De novo mode only.
    Abundance skew is:
        min [ abund(parent1), abund(parent2) ] / abund(query).

--uchimeout filename
    Output in tabbed format with one record per query sequence.
    First field is score (h), second field is query label.
    For details, see manual.

--uchimealns filename
    Multiple alignments of query sequences to parents in human-
    readable format. Alignments show columns with differences
    that support or contradict a chimeric model.

--minh h
    Mininum score to report chimera. Default 0.3. Values from 0.1
    to 5 might be reasonable. Lower values increase sensitivity
    but may report more false positives. If you decrease --xn,
    you may need to increase --minh, and vice versa.

--mindiv div
    Minimum divergence ratio, default 0.5. Div ratio is 100% -
    %identity between query sequence and the closest candidate for
    being a parent. If you don't care about very close chimeras,
    then you could increase --mindiv to, say, 1.0 or 2.0, and
    also decrease --min h, say to 0.1, to increase sensitivity.
    How well this works will depend on your data. Best is to
    tune parameters on a good benchmark.

--xn beta
    Weight of a no vote, also called the beta parameter. Default 8.0.
    Decreasing this weight to around 3 or 4 may give better
    performance on denoised data.

--dn n
    Pseudo-count prior on number of no votes. Default 1.4. Probably
    no good reason to change this unless you can retune to a good
    benchmark for your data. Reasonable values are probably in the
    range from 0.2 to 2.

--xa w
    Weight of an abstain vote. Default 1. So far, results do not
    seem to be very sensitive to this parameter, but if you have
    a good training set might be worth trying. Reasonable values
    might range from 0.1 to 2.

--chunks n
    Number of chunks to extract from the query sequence when searching
    for parents. Default 4.

--[no]ovchunks
    [Do not] use overlapping chunks. Default do not.

--minchunk n
    Minimum length of a chunk. Default 64.

--idsmoothwindow w
    Length of id smoothing window. Default 32.

--minsmoothid f
    Minimum factional identity over smoothed window of candidate parent.
    Default 0.95.

--maxp n
    Maximum number of candidate parents to consider. Default 2. In tests so
    far, increasing --maxp gives only a very small improvement in sensivity
    but tends to increase the error rate quite a bit.

--[no]skipgaps
--[no]skipgaps2
    These options control how gapped columns affect counting of diffs.
    If --skipgaps is specified, columns containing gaps do not found as diffs.
    If --skipgaps2 is specified, if column is immediately adjacent to
    a column containing a gap, it is not counted as a diff.
    Default is --skipgaps --skipgaps2.

--minlen L
--maxlen L
    Minimum and maximum sequence length. Defaults 10, 10000.
    Applies to both query and reference sequences.

--ucl
    Use local-X alignments. Default is global-X. On tests so far, global-X
    is always better; this option is retained because it just might work
    well on some future type of data.

--queryfract f
    Minimum fraction of the query sequence that must be covered by a local-X
    alignment. Default 0.5. Applies only when --ucl is specified.

--quiet
    Do not display progress messages on stderr.

--log filename
    Write miscellaneous information to the log file. Mostly of interest
    to me (the algorithm developer). Use --verbose to get more info.

--self
    In reference database mode, exclude a reference sequence if it has
    the same label as the query. This is useful for benchmarking by using
    the ref db as a query to test for false positives.
