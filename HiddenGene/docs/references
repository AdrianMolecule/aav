"I have been doing more thinking about the other idea we discussed –
 script that would scan AAV sequence in forward and reverse orientation
 in all 3 frames (0, +1, and +2) looking for signatures of conservation
 at the amino acid levels. I think this is a brilliant idea to see if
 we find any other potential proteins or ORFs in AAV. I would scan Rep
 and Cap genes. The whole 4.4kb genome! The output could be a graph
 with X axis being the positions (from 0 to 1470aa) and the Y axis
 would be the level of “conservation” between parental AAVs used as an
 input.
