            At the end of the validity period, the License granted under this
            Agreement shall terminate, and the Software will revert to

            materials are being licensed to the Licensee, as END-USER by this
            Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

            materials.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.7. Modification: Licensee may not modify, adapt, translate,
            reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble (except and SOLELY to the
            extent that an applicable Statute expressly and specifically
            prohibits such restrictions), or create derivative works based on
            the Software.<br>
            <br>
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>5.9. Third Party LPGL Software: Notwithstanding any of the

            software libraries distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
            General Public License (&quot;LGPL&quot;), hereafter referred to as
            &quot;LGPL Software&quot;:<br>
            (a) Licensor acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement restricts
            Licensee from modifying the LGPL Software; and<br>
            (b) Licensee may reverse engineer the Software SOLELY to the extent
            that is required to debug their modifications to the portions of the
            LGPL Software that is included with the Software.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.10. Termination: This Agreement will terminate automatically if
            Licensee fails to comply with the limitations described herein. In
            the event of termination by reason of the Licensee's failure to
            comply with any part of this agreement, or upon any act which shall
            give rise to Licensor's right to terminate, Licensor shall have the
            right, at any time, to terminate the license(s) and take immediate
            possession or confirm destruction of the Software and documentation
            and all copies wherever located, without demand or notice. Within
            five (5) days after termination of the license(s), Licensee will
            return to Licensor the Software in the form provided by Licensor or
            as modified by the Licensee, or upon request by Licensor destroy the
            Software and all copies, and certify in writing that they have been
            destroyed. Without limiting any of the above provisions, in the
            event of termination as a result of the Licensee's failure to comply
            with any of its obligations under this License Agreement, the
            Licensee shall continue to be obligated for any payments due.
            Termination of the License shall be in addition to and not in lieu
            of any equitable remedies available to Licensor.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.11. Injunction: In the event Biomatters reasonably believes that
            the use or distribution of any Geneious&reg; software, Geneious&reg;
            materials or Biomatters Trademarks is likely to be enjoined,
            Biomatters may, among other things, take back such infringing item
            or items and terminate the license associated with respect to such
            item or items. Biomatters may also seek judicial intervention
            including, without limitation, an injunction in the Courts of New
            Zealand and/or the State Courts of New Jersey in the United States
            of America, to which injunctive relief the Licensee expressly
            consents hereby and agrees not to oppose.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.12. Limited Reciprocal Indemnification: Each party shall, at its
            own expense, defend and indemnify the other party for damages and
            reasonable costs incurred in any suit, claim or proceeding brought
            by a third party against the indemnified party alleging any claims
            against the indemnified party for damages resulting solely and
            directly from a breach of contract or tort committed by the
            indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum
            liability of the indemnifying party under this clause shall be the
            dollar amount of fees paid to purchase Licenses to the most recent
            release of the Software.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.13. Disclaimer of Warranty: The Software is provided on an AS IS
            basis, without warranty any kind, including, without limitation, the
            warranties that the Software is merchantable, fit for a particular
            purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
            performance of the Software is borne by you, the Licensee. Should
            the Software prove defective in any respect, Licensee and not
            Biomatters, nor any of its distributors or resellers, shall assume
            the entire cost of any service and repair required. In addition, the
            security mechanisms implemented by the Software have inherent
            limitations and Licensee must determine that the Software
            sufficiently meets Licensee's requirements. This Disclaimer of
            Warranty constitutes an essential part of the Agreement. No use of
            the Software is authorized hereunder except under this
            Disclaimer.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.14. Third Party Services: The Software may facilitate Authorized
            Users interacting with third party services, such as the databases
            provided by the National Centre for Biology Information (NCBI). The
            Licensee confirms that use of any such third party service shall be
            governed solely by the terms and conditions of that service and not
            this Agreement. The Licensor shall be entitled to deem any attempt
            to access any third party services as unconditional acceptance of
            the third party terms and conditions by the Licensee. Under no
            circumstances shall Licensor be liable or responsible for lack of
            functionality or reduced performance of any third party services.
            Further, in no event shall Licensor be liable for damages of any
            kind or inconveniences caused by changes in data formats,
            communication protocols or any other aspects of such third party
            services.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO
            LEGAL THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BIOMATTERS OR ITS
            SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR
            ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
            CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
            GOODWILL, PROFIT, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR
            ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGE OR LOSSES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
            OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
            SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN
            EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT LICENSOR RECEIVED FROM LICENSEE FOR A LICENSE
            OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
            THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD
            PARTY. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY EQUIPMENT,
            SYSTEM OR NETWORK ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS USED WILL BE FREE OF
            VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR ATTACK. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND
            LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
            APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>5.16. Export Law Assurances: Licensee agrees and certifies that
            neither the Software nor other technical data received from the
            Licensor, nor the direct product thereof, will be exported out of
            the United States except as authorized and permitted by the laws and
